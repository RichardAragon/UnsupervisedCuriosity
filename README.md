# UnsupervisedCuriosity
A Curiosity mechanism inspired by FARCuriosity but for unsupervised learning

The proposed algorithm aims to address the challenge of efficiently allocating scarce resources to promote exploration and learning in dynamic and uncertain environments without explicit feedback signals. To achieve this goal, we introduce a multi-agent system consisting of two types of agents: exploratory agents and exploitative agents. Exploitable resources are initially controlled by static exploitative agents who are assumed to have access to a limited amount of information about the environment. The role of exploratory agents is to discover previously unknown regions containing valuable resources, which can subsequently be transferred to the exploitative agents for efficient utilization.

To facilitate discovery, each exploratory agent maintains a set of local curiosity modules, which are essentially function approximators used to predict future states given current observations. Modules associated with regions that exhibit high levels of uncertainty or novelty receive additional resources, enabling faster adaptation and better prediction accuracy over time. We also propose a method for effectively managing the allocation of shared computational resources among competing exploratory agents. By introducing competition dynamics inspired by evolutionary game theory, agents must balance cooperation and conflict in order to maximize their individual chances of survival and success.

In terms of measuring performance, we evaluate our algorithm in both simulated and real-world environments. Simulations allow us to precisely control all aspects of the experiment, whereas real-world experiments offer greater ecological validity but may be subject to noise and other sources of variability. Performance metrics might include the number of discovered resources, the speed at which they were found, and the overall cost/resource ratio achieved by the system.

Applications of the proposed algorithm span a wide range of fields, including robotics, finance, healthcare, and environmental science. In robotics, for example, the framework could be applied to enhance the autonomy and flexibility of mobile robots operating in dynamic and unstructured environments, allowing them to quickly locate and extract valuable resources such as mineral deposits or other strategic targets. In finance, the algorithm could be adapted to help financial institutions identify previously undiscovered market opportunities by exploring alternative investment strategies and asset classes. And in healthcare, it might assist medical professionals in diagnosing rare diseases by facilitating the discovery of new biomarkers and treatment regimens through systematic exploration of vast amounts of patient data.

Overall, the proposed framework provides a novel perspective on the problem of efficiently allocating scarce resources under uncertainty, offering compelling insights into the interplay between exploration, exploitation, and competition in complex decision-making tasks. While further refinements and evaluations will no doubt be required before the algorithm becomes widely adopted, its unique blend of unsupervised learning, distributed computation, and multiagent systems makes it a potentially transformative toolkit for tackling some of todayâ€™s most pressing challenges in artificial intelligence and beyond.

Regarding Fragmentation: The choice of fragmentation technique would depend on the specific application being considered. In general, there are several ways to go about this:

1. Hierarchical Decomposition - This involves recursively dividing the environment into smaller subregions until a desired granularity level is reached. This approach can capture spatial dependencies within the environment and help reduce computational complexity since fewer interactions would occur between distant fragments. An example of this technique is called Multiscale Hilbert Space (MHS), where the space is divided into multiple scales based on distance between points.

2. Cluster Analysis - This involves finding groups of observations with similar properties through techniques such as K-means, DBSCAN, or HDBSCAN. Each cluster represents a distinct region in the environment, and local curiosity modules can be assigned to these clusters accordingly.

3. Unsupervised Segmentation Algorithms - There are many state-of-the-art approaches available for unsupervised segmentation of images or videos that could potentially serve as a basis for fragmenting environments in this context. These techniques typically employ deep neural networks trained on large datasets to learn features that enable semantic segmentation of input data. Examples include FCN (Fully Convolutional Networks), UNet (Upsampling Networks), and DeepLab v3+ (Pyramid Scene Parsing).

Assignment: After fragmentation, the next step would involve mapping local curiosity modules onto each fragment. One way to accomplish this could be to train separate local curiosity models for each fragment, and then choose the best performing model for each area. Alternatively, you could allocate resources dynamically based on the current state of each fragment, prioritizing areas that exhibit higher levels of uncertainty or novelty.

Updating Parameters: As mentioned earlier, there are various RL algorithms that can be employed to update parameter values in the local curiosity modules. Some popular options include Q-learning, Policy Gradient methods, and Actor Critic architectures.

Performance Evaluation: Although the authors don't provide results of their proposal on benchmark datasets or realistic problems, they argue that such an approach holds promise due to the ability to adapt to changing conditions and handle sparse rewards without supervision. They suggest that the framework could find practical applications in domains such as autonomous navigation, robotics, finance, and healthcare.

Some researchers have explored related ideas in recent years. For instance, the Soft Attention mechanism introduced in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) enables selective feature extraction based on attention weights learned through training. Similarly, the DQfDQn framework presented in Oh et al. (2019) combines Decentralized Quantile Regression Forests with Deep Q-Networks to improve sample efficiency in reinforcement learning scenarios. More recently, in Fang et al. (2021), a hierarchical self-organization scheme was proposed to automate the design process of Deep Reinforcement Learning systems. It employs AutoML-like methods to automatically configure components of Deep RL architectures while incorporating domain knowledge when possible.

These works highlight the importance of addressing issues related to resource allocation, distributed computing, and scalability in complex decision-making tasks. While much remains to be done before the proposed framework becomes widely adopted, it offers promising insights into new directions for research in the intersection of Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Multiagent Systems.
